# 📅 Date Requirement Toggle Setup

## ✅ Feature Complete! 

You now have full control over whether contestants must select filming dates.

### 🔧 Setup Steps:

1. **Run the SQL script**:
   - Go to your Supabase dashboard → SQL Editor
   - Copy and paste the contents of `SUPABASE_ADMIN_SETTINGS_TABLE.sql`
   - Execute the script to create the admin_settings table

2. **Deploy your updated files**:
   - Upload the updated `admin.html` and `signup.html` to your website
   - The feature will work immediately

### 🎛️ How to Use:

#### **In the Admin Panel:**
1. **Login to admin panel** (`/admin.html`)
2. **Find the toggle** at the top of "Filming Date Management" section
3. **Toggle ON**: Contestants MUST select a filming date
4. **Toggle OFF**: Contestants can apply without selecting a date

#### **What Happens:**
- **When Required**: 
  - Red asterisk (*) shows next to date field
  - Form validation requires date selection
  - Helper text: "Choose from available filming dates"

- **When Optional**:
  - No asterisk, field is dimmed slightly  
  - Form can be submitted without date
  - Helper text: "Optional: Choose a filming date or leave blank to be contacted later"

### 💾 Data Persistence:

- **Settings are saved** to both localStorage (immediate) and Supabase (persistent)
- **Auto-sync**: Signup form loads settings from Supabase on page load
- **Fallback**: If Supabase is unavailable, uses localStorage
- **Default**: Date selection is required (safe default)

### 🧪 Testing:

1. **Test toggle in admin panel**:
   - Turn toggle ON/OFF and see status change
   - Check console for "Date selection is now required/optional" message

2. **Test signup form behavior**:
   - Open signup form in new tab
   - Refresh to load latest settings
   - Try submitting with/without date based on toggle setting

### 🔒 Security:

- Toggle setting requires admin authentication
- Supabase RLS policies protect admin_settings table
- Settings sync automatically between admin and signup form

### 📱 Use Cases:

**Turn OFF when**:
- Collecting general interest/applications
- Filming dates not yet finalized
- Want to build applicant pool first

**Turn ON when**: 
- Ready to schedule specific filming sessions
- Have confirmed dates and need commitments
- Managing capacity for specific dates
